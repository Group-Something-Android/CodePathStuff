Evaluating Apps
Google Maps
    Category: Travel
    Mobile:    The app is able to utilize phone sensors like GPS to determine location.
    Story:    Everybody uses it. Its standard. 
    Market:    Potentially everyone that gets out.
    Habit:    It so easy to you, once you go google maps,                 you don't go back. 
    Scope: It is extremely technically challenging to complete this app by the end of the program. We could do an campus only map.

Messenger 
    Category: Communication
    Story: It would not be so compelling because of the vast number of instant messaging service available.
    Market: Pretty much everybody with a smart phone needs a messaging app that will connect them with there coworkers family members, etc.
    Habit: This sort of app is addictive once most people around an user have been using it and developing a habbit.
